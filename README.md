**IG (Instagram Visualizer)**, is a site designed to make looking at instagramâ€™s data about you easier. Instagram has a feature where users can request their data, and they actually return a json file. Even as a developer, going through all those json files can be daunting. 

IG Visualizer will display the data in a digestable format and allow you to sort through your data, so you can decide what you want to see. 

No data collection is done on our end. Our repository is public (not just because of hackclub) and was purposely developed to not need a server, meaning our process is local to the client.
